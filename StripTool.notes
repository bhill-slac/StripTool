	Fixed Makefile.Host to use $(X11_LIB), etc and changed TOP to standard
	for extensions.  (StripTool directory should be just under src
	directory.)  Added StripVersion.h and changed helpmenu_cb to use
	definitions from StripVersion.h.  All future version change
	information can and should be done in StripVersion.h.

	Make selected curve the last (top) curve drawn.
	Added pan mode indicator.

	Change from Jeff Hill to make StripTool poll ca_pend_event() periodically.
	This fixes problem that StripTool will be quirky with R3.13 on any network
	that does not have very many IOCs.
