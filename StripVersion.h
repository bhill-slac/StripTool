/* Strip Tool Version information */

/* All version information should be changed here. CVS commits should
 *  be tagged as StripTool-i-j-k-l if the version is i.j.k.l.  Commit
 *  information should also be put in StripTool.notes.  The version
 *  information appears in Help|About along with the Build Date.  The
 *  Build Date is obtained from __DATE__ and __TIME__ in helpmenu_cb()
 *  in StripDialog.c, so StripDialog.c must be recompiled to update
 *  the Build Date.  It is not updated otherwise, even if other files
 *  are recompiled or the project is relinked.  */
