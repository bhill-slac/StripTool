Things that need to be done:

(1) better handling of X visuals:  currently, only PseudoColor is supported
(2) better printing:		   PS would be nice :)
(3) along with (1), better handling of colors (read-only if desired)
(4) log axis along with other functions
(5) better axis representation (more natural tic-marks)
(6) panning
(7) load history (archived) data
(8) lots of other things --please send suggestions and/or code!

  I've started working on (1) and (3), but have been waylayed.  My plan is
to add another module, StripColorManager, which will handle all the
color manipulation.
